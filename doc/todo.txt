- ship thrust not working properly around mauve moon, could be because of non-relative velocity?
- velocity should be relative to parent satellite
- why the negative prefix
- create a real-time ship to compare trajectories with calculated position
- sun and moons
- planet chunks for more efficient better rendering
- collisions?
