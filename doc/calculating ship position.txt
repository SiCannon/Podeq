problem: calculate position (r,theta) from time

so that: we can fast forward time in the simulation, i.e. warp

Using 4.43 we calc r from (v, a, e)
	since a and e are fixed for an orbit, we therefore just need v (which is "nu" by the way)
	cos(Î½) = [cos(E) - e]/[1 - e cos(E)]
	Therefore we need E, which is the Eccentric Anomaly
	
example:
	start calc() gives e, Ra, Rp, v, a, n
	we want (r,theta) for T+60s
	M = n * t (known)
	M = E - e sin E
	-> iterate to get E
	-> use this to get v
	-> calc (r, theta)
